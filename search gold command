    it will open a GUI

    select files, right click and revert

    or use: sd revert ... (if you want to revert anything under the current folder)
    
    
    

// 解決 
// 去sdclient 裡面 把 noclobber to clobber
// if you get "Can't clobber writeable file" you can run sd client and change noclobber to clobber
