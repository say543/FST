metric integration in AZURE ML in SOTA experiemnt by paulo

[Yesterday 4:40 PM] Paulo Salem da SilvaTracking results metrics in AzureML with MLflow
    
SOTA Experimentation, while I was finalizing my SOTA project for this quarter, I remembered about one great tool called MLflow and tried here. It allows the systematic collection of experimentation parameters and metrics (as well as other things) for later inspection. It is a great way of tracking and preserving what happens.

Moreover, it turns out that it is well integrated with AzureML experimentation mechanisms, so we can easily see our metrics there. Besides being convenient, it is also a matter of good governance: metrics are permanently preserved. Here's a screenshot of my latest experiment with its multiple runs (all easily collected from one single Jupyter notebook running on AML):




Here's the Precison vs Recall chart, showing all combinations I found:



In the above chart, if you look closely, you'll note that I made gradual progress up to some pretty impressive GPT-3 results. This sort of tracking thus also helps us to appreciate the gradual and cumulative efforts that went into improving our numbers.

What do you think? Do you have any other suggestions for managing, visualizing and leveraging such experimentation logs?

Yuancheng Tu
knowledge graph is a very overloaded terminology. 🙂
We want to use the "personalized" knowledge graph, which is very dynamic, not like the common sense knowledge graph

Yuancheng Tu
DL these days is easily to add entity embedding (just append them together with other inputs). In previous ML research, those knowledge (constraints) has to be added through optimization inequality or constrainted optimization.


haoda
I didn't quite get how graph embedding itself can be directly appled to intent understanding or slot tagging. Could you please explain a little bit more? thanks

how to use general knowledge graph to help lu tasks
aha i get you point. Then you mean using question and answer to resolve LU task. For instance, you can use a QA system to do Language understanding, via asking the QA system what are the entity inside your specific question. Below is an example of the corrrespond questions for the specific entity types. given a query and corresponding question you plan to asked, you can formulate NER as Question and Answer Task
Reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11476.pdf
​[3:12 PM] Haoda Chu
    This is also an interesting research direction. I also mentioned a related paper in the appendix of our proposal from Percy liang's group

I'm using my FHL project to learn about this NLP Python lib: spaCy · Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing in Python. This looks very powerful and convenient, and I heard a lot of good things about it. It is kind of a NLTK with a lot of Deep Learning under the hood and designed for industry, not academia. It can do NER, PoS tagging, dependency parsing, etc., for several languages out-of-the-box. Opinions about it? Are there better libs for the same job?

For Jennifer about access to GPT-3:
For FHL requests, they should just reach out to me via email and I can help them. If we run into capacity issues, we will revisit at that time. 

If it is not related to FHL, but for longer term use beyond the FHL period, have them email me and I will send them to the access form to request access through those channels.

Pro: Can be leveraged by multiple downstream tasks 

Con: General distillation is usually more challenging and is still a research topic 

Task specific distillation

Cons: when you have multiple downstream tasks, you have do task-specific distillation multiple times

AAAI 2021 introduction
===============================
General, I've just posted a detailed review of the recent AAAI 2021 conference (which I attended virtually) on the MSAI blog: Highlights from AAAI 2021 with takeaways for Microsoft - MSAI Team Blog (sharepoint.com)
 
Ming wants the Science team to occasionally publish there, and for some years now I've been writing summaries for my conference experiences, so this seems like a natural fit. Despite being a summary, there are actually a lot of details and screenshots, so I also intend to have a brownbag to discuss with everyone some of the most interesting points. Of course there's no way to absorb a whole (or even a large fraction) of these enormous conferences, so I think one of the best uses for them is to actually promote a broad reflection on our own problems, techniques and products, and help to define what to study next. Not to mention to have fun

MDM sepearted 8 qpc
===================
file://YANHU-SUZHOU/Users/yanhu/Desktop/MDM_MLM_onboard/tvs_assistant_clu_refactored_by_domain
// 最大的qpc
assistant_enus_tvs_mv1.queryprocessingconfiguration.

所有的domain 改成import
encoder=qd_encoder
=>
encoder=mdm_mv1::qd_encoder with import mdm_mv1=assistant_enus_tvs_uber_mv1(這個有自己的qpc, 然後各個subdomain 都要用的) 

正常的domain
calendar=qd_calendar
=>
calendar=calendar_mv1::qd_calendar
calendar_mv1=assistant_enus_tvs_calendar_mv1 wtih import 的qpc 
assistant_enus_tvs_calendar_mv1.queryprocessingconfiguration 內部會再用到uber 裡面的encoder 還有rule 的pipeline

cmf_generic 是為了要 clu studio 的 query context,  clu studio 的preproceesed query 還是從 qd_encoder_tokenizer

但是拿raw Query 沒有考慮小寫   之後on board 要確定這次事情
