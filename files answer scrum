phrase 代表第幾個attempt

Phase - I (Deployed WW)
1. Files domain confidence > 0.50 (originally 0.35)
2. Allowed files intent: file_search (removed file_open,file_share,file_download,file_navigate)
3. Donot trigger if any of these slots present : to_contact_name,sharetarget_type,sharetarget_name,meeting_starttime,file_folder,data_source_name,data_source_type
 
Phase - II (Deployed MSIT)
4. Do not trigger if "attachment" slot present
5. Do not trigger if more than 2 'o' slot present. Eg. donot trigger for "git pull master file" having 3 'o' slots
6. Filter out results if query matched against team name in contact name. Eg. Ankit Singh (Azure) should not return for query like "azure files"
7. Do not trigger for queries with file_name or file_keyword slot and number for chars is less than 2. e.g. donot trigger for "x files"

CMF MLG regex 的說明 from yong
========================
https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/IPGSPIN/Intent/QAS%20Wiki/Regular%20Expressions%20in%20MLGTools.aspx

[3:04 PM] Yong Ni
    
BTW, 这个是官方用法 Intent - Regular Expressions in MLGTools (sharepoint.com)
1. Regex: by default, single-word based, case-sensitive
2. RegexIC: single-word based, case-insensitive
3. RegexL: multi-word regex (means at least one space between tokens), case-sensitive
4. RegexICL: multi-word regex, case-insensitive
(1 liked)​[3:04 PM] Yong Ni
    
CMF只是直接复用MLG代码，并没有加新东西
這邊的word 指的是把整個query 當作一個word 

regex regexIc 是整個query 要轉乘single token

然後 ^ 和 & 才有用
SingleTokenView --in=filekeywordOrfilename_replaced --out=filekeywordOrfilename_replaced_singletoken


RegexL / RegexICL 整個query 看成一個list 可以match 一個token or 多個token
這個時候因為可以match 一個single token 所以 ^ 和 & 就沒有用處了

ranker rules discussion with Eric 01282021

met 1:
if see web(top down) / file search semantic frame / file domain score with a threshold , ranker only knows the top domain and other candidates only
=> demote web
demote web domains and let other domains compete with each other
cons: it might let other domains overtrigger as well

met 2:
if see web(top down) / file search semantic frame / file domain score with a threshold , ranker only knows the top domain and other candidates only
=> boost files domain score
bosst files domain score
it might not affect other domains, it does, that means files domain overtrigger


how to implement:
one week to implement rule and setup flight in rankder (? i think this flight can be the same what model D has )

how to test:
1> skill team with rankder flight to run frisbee test, this will not trigger icm
2> rolls out to rings eg : devring -> microsoft ring
each ring has its own frisbee test and if it fails, it might trigger ICM

(personally i do not prefer the second method since postmoderm is not a good way)


next step
decide 'threshold' and create a work item for eric
1> using kusto log to check and analyze query
kusto query:

let starttime = datetime("2020-11-18 00:00:00");
let endtime = datetime("2020-12-04 00:00:00");

pcs centric search discussion
============================
[2:37 PM] Mehar Yeleti
    
Donovan Lange
My only comment on that one is the KR here seems kind of squishy in terms of what we actually need to deliver/land.  I know that PCS is a large effort, but if there's a way to make the work/deliverable crisper... (however, ok to take offline)
Thanks Donovan .. makes sense.. we started off engaging with partners back in Q2 expecting a lot of dependencies from PCS.. and now it almost feel like we might not need a KR as there is minimal to No dependencies for features slated in Q3 for PCS (need to also find if its true for MSO as it is for TM and OM).. However, LU is very adjacent to their experiences in Q3 - for example, Q3 PCS features include User Entry points in QF (e.g. Typing in search bar and clicking on people name suggestion).. For now I kept the KR since there is definitely hard dependencies in Q4 and we might need to do ground work before that..
Edited​[2:51 PM] Yong Ni
    
Mehar, PCS doesn't ask for parity support with speech input on TM (powered by voice skills), right?
​[2:52 PM] Mehar Yeleti
    
thats right 
(1 liked)​[2:52 PM] Mehar Yeleti
    
PCS entry at least for now mainly through typed search
​[2:55 PM] Mehar Yeleti
    
I think even for future, they wouldn't think PCS for Voice skill entry.. Now the team is going mostly towards convergence and in Cobalt they are having plan for Search fall back in most scenarios..
​[2:59 PM] Mikkel Conradi
    
From my perspective, the initial concern about PCS from the UU team was that it was a feature that would be competing with NL.  I then reviewed the PCS documentation and found that it is a feature that is well-supported by end-user research, and I think we should not think of it as a competitor, but rather a feature that can have synergy with NL, because NL can be used to guide the sub-intent in PCS.  (PCS have verticals, often referred to as sub-intents.)  So in my view the main role we play is to ensure that, in NL scenarios that involve people + potentially other entities, the NL signals are properly used to land users in the best sub-intent.  But I do think it is a complex feature that should be carefully designed and tested.

    Is the schema very different from email search data?
​[12/7 10:38 AM] Hasmik Tananyan
    We have module which extracts data from heron not sure if it will support file search data if it is very different
​[12/7 10:47 AM] Haoda Chu
    Hasmik Tananyan You can find the latest schema here: https://carina/clu/cortana/TEAMSMESSAGE
The schema of teams message is quite similar to NL email search (like a subset). Maybe we can directly reuse you module without any change
​[12/7 10:50 AM] Hasmik Tananyan
    We need to try if it works will be super cool

So is it fair to suggest the following action items:


	
Haoda Chu \ Paulo Salem da Silva - Provide Teams Message dataset to Hasmik - Owner - Haoda Chu \ Paulo Salem da Silva
	Hasmik Tananyan - Extend the evaluation tool to support V2 NL Transformations to setup E2E evaluation pipeline. Some of the questions that we should be able to answer are:
	

		
Currently confidence score is set to 0.2 for NL to trigger. What happens if I set to 0.3 - What would be the alteration rate in this experiment?
		I have a new model - What are the diffs in terms of NL triggering compared to older model
		Owner: Hasmik Tananyan
	
	
	Sharanya Vemu \ Mikkel Conradi - To incorporate this in Q3 planning

// order does matter

// this case both models being loaded
// 
.\QCSQueryLabelWithLES.exe --encoding utf-8 --legacyAllowUnusedParameters --verbose --loadingThreadsNum 1 --threadsNum 1 -c E:\searchgold\deploy\builds\data\answers\QASB2PlaceHolder,E:\searchgold\deploy\builds\data\answers\QasMSSearch01DS  --clientId "domains_all_rings_test" --variant griffinsdf_M365Search --datasets QASB2PlaceHolder,QasMSSearch01DS -i "E:\CoreScienceDataStaging\datasets\TeamsVoiceSkills\Test\Mustpass_TVS_Files_Golden_after-filtering.tsv" --queryInColumn 5 -o E:\CoreScienceDataStaging\TestResults\Evaluation\all_after_old.Default


[question] with the same client setup and super set in SDF and subset in WW ?

// sdf
[query_domains:domains_all_rings_test]
cmfgeneric=cmfgeneric::qd_cmfgeneric
linksearch=linksearch::qd_linksearch
files=files_mv3::qd_files

// WW
[query_domains:domains_all_rings_test]
files=files_mv3::qd_files

wtih above client , what is the effect?
Ans: it will load super set from SDF



[question] Parity setup (same clientId with same domains configured, and model files existing in both datasets) in two datasets won't cause any issue -- this should be straightforward 

(BTW, double check if memory unchanged when loading multiple datasets but having same model files -- loading two datasets with "--datasets" parameter).

// sdf
[query_domains:domains_all_rings_test]
files=files_mv3::qd_files

// WW
[query_domains:domains_all_rings_test]
files=files_mv3::qd_files




2. If one model file in the QASB2PlaceHolder is modified unintentionally (no change on the same named file in QasMSSearch01DS), which dataset model file will be actually loaded with "--datasets" parameter - does the order of the specified datasets matter?



3. Verify when giving only one dataset name to "--datasets", we can see differences - usually would be seeing more domains when using QASB2PlaceHolder alone (== "--datasets QASB2PlaceHolder,QasMSSearch01DS" ), and less in QasMSSearch01DS.

==================


two featurizer

qd_files_slot_clustudio_partial_pattern_featurizer

要follow 這個order 來train model

所以要照這個order
        <LabelInfo Name="data_source_name" ShortcutKey="O" />
        <LabelInfo Name="data_source_type" ShortcutKey="O" />
	<LabelInfo Name="attachment" ShortcutKey="O" />

for deployment story for mv5 to b2
參考這個git branch 
users/chiecha/attachment_model_slot_retrain_09222020


step1:
only leave  
[query_domains]
files=qd_files

step2:
remove cmfgeneric /common all related pipeline


step3: 
remove qd_files_domain_contextual_lu_featurizer 
這個 ouput 會有別的featurizer cover 所以不用考慮input output renaming 直接移除就可以
files_domain_pattern_match_score
contexxual rule pipeline


step4:
remove qd_files_common_domain_intents_featurizer
這個 ouput 會有別的featurizer cover 所以不用考慮input output renaming 直接移除就可以

feature set in QAS
========================

<question>
18: MaaFGlobalIdAllocator 
--in=intent_ngram_1gram,intent_ngram_2gram,intent_ngram_3gram,intent_mlg_lexicon,intent_PreviousTurnIntent_default,intent_PreviousTurnDomain_default,intent_TaskFrameStatus_default,filekeywordOrfilename_matches_conj 
--out=intent_features --mapping=files_enus_mv3.intent.features.bin

0 to 7 是input 的 feture order 
files_enus_mv1.intent.features.bin

// first colmun : input feature 的名子
// secomd column : local feature 

for 
        Inputs:
                ExternalInput1 (tag: 0, string: 2)
                        open[0,0]=1.0
                        def[1,1]=1.0
        Output:
                intent_ngram_1gram (tag: 2, string: 0)
                        6[0,0]=1.0
                        24[0,0]=1.0

6,24 就是second column (因為是1 gram first column 會是1)

在一個desc.txt  的編號還要問一下

// third 
會map 到 gloal 的global feature index


0	1	0
0	2	1
0	3	2
0	4	3
0	5	4
0	6	5
0	7	6
1	13	7
3	10	8
3	26	9
7	10	10
7	26	11
0	24	12


ngram 的index 跟token
E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\output_intent_answer_pergra\intent_svm\tmp\build_tmp\intent.ngram\1gram.txt

同樣的token 會增加 begin 跟end 的 額外的features 


BeginningOfDoc find	0
find	1

meeting	51
meeting EndOfDoc	52



<question>
feature 的order
features order(寫死) (starting from zero)
1gram
2gram
3gram
lexcion (desc,  all content inside will share the same feature set name, the first column)
pcfg
external feature (previous intent )

additional featurization pipieline
數組的順序  的order


<question>
addtional external input 只能用
BodySurfaceStream
not
external_input1 (會是empty, 不抱錯)

所以要preprocessing  是必須的 

不能用自己的


yong 
offline

pattern.title.conj.pipeline.txt

offline 的desc 跟online 的也不一樣


<question>
有時候生成的feature set name 會沒有mapping 到global
可能是traninnig data 太少 or CMF 
//prune 
E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\output_intent_answer_pergra\intent_svm\tmp\build_tgt\intent
features.bin

/unprune
有些tranining data 
E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\output_intent_answer_pergra\intent_svm\tmp\build_tmp\intent
features.unpruned.bon



<question>
for external feature
files_enus_mv1.domain.features.bin 
	
	Make sure it has 4 in the first column (4 is the extra feature set) 
But not sure why it has two (0,1)
yong 哥 說 有一定的概率會有0, 1  原因是QAS　feature set 的問題　但是因該不影響
4 0 13 
4 1 14

slot 新增slot 的注意事項
=======================

參考這個git branch 
(users/chiecha/attachment_model_slot_retrain_09222020)

files_enus_mv5.slots.config.xml
要確保有正確的slot

qd_files_queryparser
這邊的數目也要有正確的 number
param:TagForState 這行要自己改
參考 generated model.queryprocessingconfiguration.ini


=======================
intent 新增intent 的注意事項
=======================
files_enus_mv2.domain_intent.multiturn.def.txt (common domain only)
files_enus_mv3.domain_intents.multiturn.pipeline.txt 的 output feature 要調整 numOutputs 配合intent 的個數
RandomFeature --in=BodySurfaceStream --out=zero_intent --rv=constant --val=0 --tagidval=0 --fromval=-1 --toval=-1 --numOutputs=10 --outputZeroValueFeatures=true


files_enus_mv1.intents.classes
files_enus_mv1.intent.classes.txt

這三個cases 都要對才行

=======================
新增intent pipeline 注意事項
=======================


files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.pipeline.txt
files_enus_mv3.intent_svm_override.pipeline.txt
files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.conditions.hotfix.txt
files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.preprocess.fst

files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.entities.config.xml
add new intent for select_more


files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.map.txt
add 10 to map to include all intent


files_enus_mv3.intent.pattern.bin

=======================
select_more test commoand

Multi-turn evaluation sets
Given the conflict - it is a MUST for almost all domains and we CANNOT get this value from CIV’ in cosmos.

Here is what we will do:

    For CoW and TVS, stop multi-turn annotation going forward
    For existing data of CoW and TVS, only run eval and report numbes on first-turn
    For PME, keep as is, otherwise we will NOT have any data

這邊需要人的來donate 然後請他們用tool 打cortana 然後輸出trace
撈trace 出來分析cl

要有positive example
negative example

benefit:

1> run e2e
   每個人有自己的synthetic data set, 可以跑e2e
    抓trace 出來分析
   麻煩是每個人都要用tool 打query 但是一次可以打多個
   也可以看看recall 有沒有明顯的上升
   skill 可能要思考怎麼log 把information show 出來  因為production
   redempted 什麼都看不到
   
   
2> 這個set 也可以向zhiguo 的contexual lu set 一樣  單獨跑QAS (不過這個case 跟zhiguo 的solution 功能就重疊了) 

   
zhiguo 有說這樣要避免biase

有一個叫做 task form chaining 
可以從email task from 裡面 call 到另外一個 skill 像stack 的方式  做完在跳回來
task form 就可以不會cancel 就會continue
concrete examples 就是 email task from 裡面call note 做add_note



// potential issue
另外cortana session 裡面的 time 以前是 15minutes 現在好像是40 minutess
也就是說taskfrom state = compelte 不一定代表一個session 已經finished
有可能之前的 previous turn/ previous intent 會繼續向後傳
這也解釋我在COW 上面看到 有些query 有之前的previous domain/ previous intent 即使task form 面已經complete
但是這個目前沒有解

by meeting (自己記憶)

1> show the file i was working  on
i wants canonical value
? not sure the purpose but can check

show the file we were wrking on
? has mentioned we do not support relation name
? need to discuss wtih Tao

主要在
3.allow correcting the file name
disambiguation - what file do you want
confirmation turn - do you want to share this?

? generic selection 大概不能work

// slot support 就可以 intent 可能還好  
i want xxx 
lt review deck
// ?但是這個可能要 intent
i want a different file

? 問一下communication 怎麼support call 的


4. show fakkback options to create likeihood of success 
disambiguation - what file do you want
confirmation turn - do you want to share this?

None of these, None, No
   這個時候task form 不會complete
   
"show me more" etc. will result in further exhausting of MRU files 
   ? none 的case 沒有清楚 , none 可能是上一個
   這個時候可能就需要intent  有提到select_other 這種name
   
   ? generic selection 可以吃intent 嗎?
   可以的  可以吃select_other 跟select_none
   communication 已經有用  可以問eran
   
   這個是generic selection 的code 可以看到有用select_other select_none 的example

disambigation不管3.4 
都需要兩個turn
trun 1:
i want a different file / show me more  讓generic selection stop 然後  cortan 再問一句  what you want to open
trun 2:
lt revew deck, 這個時候 skill owns 了 才可以繼續

confirmation turn
不管3,4 都做不到continue task form
只吃confirm yes, no  必須要end task form 才可以下一個

3. User rejects the matches presented 
only intent i guess
None of these,  
None,  
No  ? 覺得有點問題 那以後怎麼reject form
None of these, show me more  
No, show me more 

4. User explicitly asks for more results 
only intent i guess
Show me more 
Get more results 
Show more files 

5. User wants to change the file name queried, but doesn’t specify which one in the same turn 
only intent i guess
I want a different file 
I want a different power point 
I want a different one  
None of these, I want a different file 
No, I want a different file 


6. User wants to change the file name queried and specifies it in the same turn 
not sure intent, i think file_name 
no need promoted and it is supported now
? not sure how it works  might be just slot is enough
Marketing review deck; 
I want marketing review deck 
None of these, I want marketing review deck 


8. User wants to share the file with a person 

? this is already support




by eran communication domain
有select_none 跟select_other
(command 只有select_none)

//intent pattern for generating select_none, select_other
luna_communication_enus_mv1.intents.selectNoneSendText.infile
luna_communication_enus_mv1.intents.selectNoneSendText.bin

if new client (最好新增client 因為要對應)
griffinsdf_M365Search.QASB2PlaceHolder.queryprocessingconfiguration.ini
step1:

[import]
files=files_enus_mv5

[clients]
filestest=filestest

[query_domains:filestest]
deriveFromClient=
files=files::qd_files


// 這個只有derive for client 沒有新的model 因為新的還沒有要道worldwide  要worldwide 才要放
griffinsdf_M365Search.QasMSSearch01DS.ClientIdConfig

[clients]
filestest=filestest

[query_domains:filestest]
deriveFromClient=






step2:
新增client 的對應 (prod 跟msit shares the same configuration)
griffinsdf_M365Search.QasMSSearch01DS.ClientIdConfig.ini

[global]
filestest=filestest:true

step3: (? 這個因該是answer team 要改)
這個是answer 要pass 的flight (實際上http 也可以pass 這個flight)
substrate search 的config
https://dev.azure.com/msasg/Bing_and_IPG/_git/SubstrateSearch?path=%2Fprivate%2FComponents%2FQu%2FQuV2%2FSubstrateSearch.QuV2.Plugins%2FQas%2FQasB2InputCreatorConfigurationV2.ini&_a=contents&version=GBmaster

people 的example
customconstraints&FLT.PeopleEntityServeQasModelV2:true=peopletest:true
customconstraints&GWSFLT.PeopleEntityServeQasModelV2:true=peopletest:true

這兩個因該是所謂的feature flight 可以被使用的? (wait for yong 's confirmation)
FLT.PeopleEntityServeQasModelV2
GWSFLT.PeopleEntityServeQasModelV2  

==============================
flight new domain model  (cortana) 04032020
==============================

flight 的link
https://exp.microsoft.com/a/feature/d672a5df-4708-4f77-94a8-893c29e3e153



正常程序先改flight 再改control tower(needing yubi key)

GriffinProd_Cortana.QAS12HttpQAS.ClientIdConfig.ini

step1:

有
// yue setup 好的
//他建議我用 lufeatureflight2
; Feature flight for lufeatureflight1
; Feature flight for lufeatureflight2
; Feature flight for lufeatureflight3

如果只想改teams 的traffic
Microsoft_Teams_enus_LuFeatureFlightTwo=luscenario:teams&feature.lufeatureflight2:1&ipe_locale:en-us,en-gb,en-au,en-in,en-ca
// comment below two
;Microsoft_UWP_enus_LuFeatureFlightTwo=luscenario:uwp&feature.lufeatureflight2:1&ipe_locale:en-us,en-gb,en-au,en-in,en-ca
;Microsoft_OMC_enus_LuFeatureFlightTwo=luscenario:outlookcommute&feature.lufeatureflight2:1&ipe_locale:en-us,en-gb,en-au,en-in,en-ca

這樣帶著feature  feature.lufeatureflight2 就會fall back 到UWP  OMC 的default  developer/microsoft/preview/public 的default ring
只有teams 的traffic 會 分percentage 一部分給  這個client id
Microsoft_Teams_enus_LuFeatureFlightTwo
      這個precentage 是在control tower submit request 說 percentage traffic 要帶 什麼feature (lufeatureflight2) 
      control tower不需要知道client id 只負責加traffic
      QAS收到featuure 在divert 在不同的 client id 


step2:
GriffinProd_Cortana.QAS12HttpQAS.queryProcessingConfiguration.ini
; Feature flight for lufeatureflight2
[query_domains:Microsoft_Teams_enus_LuFeatureFlightTwo]
deriveFromClient=Microsoft_Teams_enus_Public

override 一個新的files_domain_model 就可以 (參照 [query_domains:Microsoft_UWP_enus_Microsoft] 的config 就行)
用一個新的version 來做就可以




step3:
yubi key
https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CortanaCore/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={6d6ae133-c9c8-400d-bfd8-ae8feec6ff9f}&action=edit&wd=target%28Compliance.one%7C6bf6e4b5-7e77-4ffd-98e9-387243c735ec%2FEnroll%20Your%20YubiKey%7C69aa251d-a7e9-4fdd-908d-0e01a4dc7c44%2F%29
yubi key 要找grace要

then change control tower
dev 50% 依次submit change ,  100% 依次submit change (50%  可以configure 但是一班就走50)
microsoft 50% 依次submit change ,  100% 依次submit change (50%  可以configure 但是一班就走50)
preview / public 一班都部submit 


p.s 一班developer 100% 就把 把main qpc改过来，deploy之后stage那里就可以停了
    
bootcamp 說stop 會有問題是lutest那个flight，stop其实也没问题(因為會divert 到microsoft 的traffic as yue said)

但是這邊我測的是feature flight (優先及大於lutest)



一旦dev microsoft ready
就可以停掉flight then
either
1>(我prefer method 1)
在all_domain 直接用新的取代
or
2>
xxxx_enus_selfserve / xxxx_enus_developer / xxxx_enus_microsoft / xxxx_enus_preview / xxxx_enus_public
各別自己override

04302020
50% 50% deve

05012020
100% dev

05072020
promoting mv3 to teams develop ring directly , configuration 還沒改
05082020
stop developer feature flight


05072020
50% 50% microsoft



06042020
microsoft ring 沒有到100% 直接stop 因為devicecontrol 的限制　　之後直接就replace 掉就好

conlufilename and conlufilenamekp are flights for full file name and file name key phrases respectively. 
The former is enabled in 50% of Microsoft Ring, the latter in 100% of Developer ring

https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/kusto.aria.microsoft.com/databases/e218bc2998bd4a9090d31c34974753fa



12012020
for model D setupo
ab test 没有100% 最多 50/50


'add new progression'
for roll out  有50 跟100  一班都選roll out
點進去會有兩個可以選  忽略上面 , 下面的就可以直接start
for A/B test 
就只有50%



12032020
一班如果roll out (devring) 100%
status 會是running
然後左下角會有STOP 的 button for emergency
如果DRI 點了stop 之後  status from 'running' to 'stopped'

這個時候原本的progression 就沒辦法重新 enalbe devring

那可以選iterative progression 會複製舊的progression
然後在eg: developer ring 重新click advance 就可以追上原本的progression 但是還是必須要自己點

<email_title> RE: Correct slots not getting produced
04202020

// 這個代表prompt for value
"MissingValue": "FileMissingDialogAct",	
// 這邊代表prompt for selection
selection 也可以做prompted for value 
if user says positon_refe, 選擇
if users says "string", generic model 會做string 的fuzzy search
"Disambiguation": "FileDisambiguationDialogAct",



openfileV1
from 
"SlotConstraintType": "Hard",
"SlotNames": [ "position_ref" ]
to
openfilev2
"SlotConstraintType": "Soft",
"SlotNames": [ "position_ref", "file_name", "file_keyword", "file_type" ]

When users say  ‘the first one’ then  generic selection will consume  position_ref.( here I confirm lu does generate correct slot)
When users say string, then lu slot does not affect result so generic selection will use that to do filter.
Thus, you should use Hard constraint to align with above scenario.
"SlotConstraintType": "hard",
"SlotNames": [ "position_ref" ]
    ?code 怎麼process 還不太懂
    
一旦generic take over  除了position_ref slot 會被filter 其他的slot 因該會被generic selection mode l給忽略
TCP Signals
tcp 是個platform

taskfrom Entitirys 代表是上個turn 的結果
eg:  "file_keyword",
"State" : "PromptedForSelection",
"Value" : "skills"
   代表上個turn 有填入的skills
   
LU Constraints
    這邊有cinstraunt type 還有盯著的slot
    
TaskFrame Status

"RE: Search Keyword LU issue"
有hard constraint or soft constraint  dictation 的constraint
參考page
https://cortanawiki.azurewebsites.net/engineering/gettingstarted/1pbfLuConstraints.html
'LU runtime perform filter/override action for constraints' 的整理　　(不同constraint by different components to consume 有不同的結果, 
這邊是postprocessing slot constraint 的討論)

dictation:
　　　　　lu runtime 把　lu result ignore lu runtime 會把整個string 當成一個slot
　　　　　result here:
　　　　　把default整個string 當成一個slot (. 是被 speech recogation給加上去的) 然後lu result 會被filter
         所以是把SR 的整個input 所以才有.
hard:
        lu runtime 把　lu result 根據skill 提供的list 來filter 
        只會用到lu 的result
soft:
        基本上沒有dictation 沒有hard 產生的功能
	? 

我猜因該是search for files(files domain) / search for (teams domains)
first turn 所以files  domain 因該已經support 
? 因該是train 還好　　有file_type 的還是有support 
雖然  slot.taskframe.file_keyword.promptedForValue.infile  有些support 但是沒完整　　最好把file_type 都加完整

ans : CMF是把所有类似PreviousTurnDomain(calendar)TaskFrameStatus(inprogress)的字符串都打包成一个字典bin文件，然后在线上直接那输入的字符串和那个字典bin做match

不能work
E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\cortana_calendar_enus_mv9.domain.model.pipeline.txt
在這個pipeline 為什麼要自己加pipeline
因為off line training CMY是可以的
但是online external column data 沒辦法來  需要自己組裝(只要不是原生support 的feature 都是需要組裝) 
這邊自己加pipeline 把PreviousTurnDomain() TaskFrameStatus() 自己組裝成一個single string representation 



question 為何不要用兩個seperateed feature   PreviousTurnDomain   TaskFrameStatus  分別填1?
CMF 算法的限制
目前的算法只要看见有1就会可能有加分，所以最终的效果就是如果只有一个是1另一个为0的情况下，你的domain score也会增加，但理想情况是希望在这种情况下不加分，甚至最好减分
如果两个feature一个在+1，另一个-1，也不能保证最终合并在一起的时候+1的那个效果超过了-1的，最后其实还是在加分……


最好還是用合併的feature 缺保  satifsied case =1.  unsatisfed case = 0  一定拉的開


如果要判斷有沒有debug 
E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\output_adhoc_intent\intent_svm\tmp\train.tsv

<email tile>
RE: 2232029 - File_navigate intent should win
Ling's reply
I will add case 6 into the below examples.

Case 6: Different query verbs, e.g., “find”, “search for”, “show me”, “go to”, “direct me to”, …. Examples below
-	Search for my recent files
-	Find the files that I  created yesterday
-	Show me all the shiproom deck
-	Go to the recent files tab
-	Direct me to recent files that Peter shared with me via email
-	Look for the MS build demo scripts

Current LU status:
-	Explicit navigation word such as “go to”, “direct me to” and “navigate to” will be grouped into file_navigate intent; explicit search word such as “search for”, “find me” will be grouped into the find_search intent. Any verb that are at the boundary will be grouped into file_search intent as default, for example, “show me”, “look for”, etc. To summarize, we don’t specifically mark up verb “search for” for now. 

等meeting note
目前direct me to recent files 會生成file_search  可能會需要改
但是看training data direct 都是file_navigate 可能是dsat 我想 
跟yue 要一下file 看起來  也沒有特別  可能真的就是dsat 在家進去train

RE: First step - NL File Search on SPO

另外 file answer 這邊有提到
We have flighted files answer integration in MSIT (.2% in coverage) and got a flat scorecard. 

On endpoints like Outlook mobile where there is a files answer, our main goal to integrate with Query API is to ensure there is continuity in results when users navigate from answer to files tab to see all results. Files tab will be powered using Query API.

On endpoints like TM where there is no files answer (yet), we are using this integration to bootstrap NL file search requirements given the LU integration is not yet prioritized. @Mayank Chadha/@Hao Zhang (MSAI) as FYI.

lexicon bin for slot training

this file name
slots.lexicon.desc.txt


MLGTools.exe 直接生成bin

1.2.341 folder 沒有MLGTool  
CMF 是共用底層的c++ 不用用到MLGTools.exe
兩個行為一不一樣很難說

==============
you can use mlgtool to compile this bin directly 

/? 1.2.341 no MLGTools.exe so using  1.2.301

this will generate bin  in directory

with filename
files_enus_mv1.slot.mlg.lexicon.bin




已知
// . 不work

用cosmo 11 discussion

在search bar
搜尋vc selector 就可以加上cosmo 11 science prod
這個是我們現在的solution

This creates a scope job.  You can track the jobs on the cluster at 
// 要改成cosmo 11
https://cosmos11.osdinfra.net/cosmos/science.prod/users/chiecha/

To see just your jobs, click the “My Jobs” tab.  
Each job also has a link, e.g., 
when I ran this, it created a link at https://cosmos09.osdinfra.net/cosmos/relevance/_Jobs/0804c692-0bc4-4c29-901b-117dbe4e60d5 .  
From the links, you can go to the “Script” tab to see the script that was run.  
The “Job Stages” tab tells you how close the job is to completing.

'Build measurement set for 3S answers using MSB logs'
Just to clarify the purpose of this evaluation set for 3S after our offline sync.
1.	This 3S measurement set is aiming to represent the real user query distributions in MSB. After bucketize sampling, weight of each bucket will need to be included when creating this set.
2.	However, the target sampling that I’m working on is to create target sets that are aiming to have large coverage on data variance. The query pool for target sampling can be from multiple data sources. Frequency doesn’t play too much critical role here. Hence frequency/weight will not be included in this case.

Since 3S measurement set is prepared per domain, hence domain confidence score will be used for bucketize sampling. And we can get three sets in one run. There will be no need to use the semantic similarity approach (very time consuming when the pool is huge and this approach is not aether friendly).

Here are the steps:
1.	Build an aether pipeline to generate three raw measurements for annotation. Data source can be changed whenever needed. ( aether://experiments/eaf0f62c-9e59-4370-b3d7-d92c92b87800)
2.	Annotation pipeline to annotate each set independently for each domain (These annotation task will be scheduled after our first batch of Nov Teams and OMC data, ETA is around end of Nov)
3.	Check in CSDS repo. No DA review required for this case. Though it is measurement set, it will still be open for you to play with given this is the first set. 

Mode details can be found in this page. MSB Data Sampling  (Web view)

3s search
   need to find out what tests available?
   for golden sets
Scenarios tests
Integration Tests
FrisBee Test ( only for cortana)




how to sync with skill teams regularly?
    pretty hard
    
    
 scenarios is more detailed compared to intent
 one intent will have differene scenarios


07312019
swtich from CLU.core.1.2.286 to 1.2.305 for training 看看


================
07302019
files schema 跟team schema 討論
================


intent level 

1. file navigation intent
instance1 (for teams) for teams 這個部分 file_search mpa 回去file_navitation
    要考慮會不會產生overtrigged
instance2 (for 3s answer) 這個部分  file_search 還是file_search


<discuss>
跟skill teams 的討論  感覺不太care 是不是navigation intent, file search ?


show me my recent files / show me my files
show me files i was working on 
只用slot 無法分辨
一定要file navigate  有沒有slot 無關

but 
open the files I recently worked on
這個是file_open (在) spec 但是也需要 slot


所以需要maintain 兩個intent
slots 就用 file_recency (要不要包含I 再說) 跟file_action



  <action_item>
       teams_intent_training_after_filter.py done
       E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\resource\intents.txt 加intent



slot level

2. file_filerecency
   slot 變成 file_recency
   目前plan 用files 的file_action  (雖然只tag action, not i was)
    把一些特別的verb 轉成要求的file_recency 的canonical value
    來support 
    
    
3.1 file_sharetarget
   instance1 (for teams) for teams 這個部分 會expose for cortana skill team
   instance2 (for 3s answer)  這個tag 會被移除
   p.s 兩個physical instatnce 會有不同的featurier

<discuss>
    覺得file_sharetarget 要新加
    person 除非用canonical value 來tell 否則很難
    其他的很難train 我覺得


3.2 teammeeting_title
   instance1 (for teams) for teams 這個部分 會expose for cortana skill team
   instance2 (for 3s answer)  這個tag 會被移除
   p.s 兩個physical instatnce 會有不同的featurier

<discuss>
    覺得teammeeting_title 要新加
   
4. file_search
    直接給teams 同name
  
5. file_name or file_keyword
    直接給teams 同name
    
6. start_time
    直接給teams 同name
7.file_type
    直接給
    
   
   
目前剩下的issue
 1> two start_date  or start time issue  
 open the <?>last week<?> file i edited yesterday
 we can tag two start date 但是不知道skill teams 怎麼處理
  
  what are <file_keyword> last weeks tasks </file_keyword>
  find <file_type> note </file_type> from <start_date> last week </start_date> <file_keyword> to do ' s </file_keyword>
  <start_date> last week </start_date> ' s <file_type> notes </file_type>.
  
  yong : 這個先不管 丟給partner teams 
  要嘛只tag 一個 or  tag 2 個 但是先不管skill teams 會怎麼動
 2> 
 open the file <cnotact>A shares to me 
 open the file i share to susan
 
 if we need to differentaite, we might need to add two like from_contact_name and contact name.
 
 yong:
 加兩個slot 然後兩個都tag
   實際的my stuff data 兩個都存在
  
  
  <action_item>
       files_mystuff_after_filter.done
       
       用contact_name 跟to_contact_name
       這樣to_contact_name 基本都是i
       contact_name 有i 也一堆沒有i 的
       
       teams 的在說
       E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\resource\slots.txt 
       先加slots
       lexicons 的部分
       E:\fileAnswer_data_synthesis\CMF_training\resource\LexiconFiles\slots.lexicon.desc.txt
       把contact_name 跟to_contact_name 用不同lexciocn name 但是content 依樣
       contact_name:Trie(.\resource\LexiconFiles\contact_name.txt)
       tp_contact_name:Trie(.\resource\LexiconFiles\to_contact__name.txt)
       p.s 現在兩個裡面都沒有i (contact_name) and me(to_contact_name) 
       ? 可以之後考慮要不要加

  <file_action>
  open photos
  show me a picture of one hundred and seven
  ? open / show  tagged as file_action  這個之後要討論一下  覺得不用tag
  work on 覺得只tag work 比較好  schema 要跟著調整
  my recent downloads
  ? downloads 不知道要不要tag
  
  
  attached 
  ? 不知道skill teams要不要  但是我覺得都先tag 吧 等compliant 再說
  
  
  titled <title> christmas list </title>
  titled 先 不tag file action
  
  <start_time>
  ? recent 藥用start time or file_recency  
  目前把recent / recently  大小寫都變成order_ref
  因為order_ref 要用來代替teams 裡面的 file_recency
  靠canonical value 來給
  
   
  find the task note i created last week  沒學好  要找找


  <order_ref>
   要保留

     grocery 不是title 要轉乘keyword
     grocery list -> keyword -> file_keyword
     
     christmas list
     不是title 要轉乘keyword
     christmas list -> keyword -> file_keyword
     
     除非有title
     titled <keyword> christmas list </keyword>
     christmas list title -> file_name

     tasl list -> keyword -> file_keyword
     
     find me my music list

      先把它當成 title -> file_name 
      
      
      ? marked 要討論後面是file name or file type
      目前把called , titled 當作file_name
      現在先不管
      
  <file_keyword>
  
     因為list 在 file 不是tpye 
  
     what is on my <title> to-do </title> <data_type> list </data_type> ?
     這to-do list 都轉成keyword  -> file_keyword 因為沒有.doc
     
     
     show me my to do list
     to do list 要轉乘file_keyword
     
     what is in my shopping list
     shopping list 改成file_keyword
     
     <keyword> shopping </keyword> <data_type> list </data_type>

     teams 裡面是data_type 但是這個file navigation 會給teams 
     怎麼tag 沒差  把她轉成file_keyword     
     
     
     what is in my <title> shopping list </title> ?
     shopping list 變成 keyword -> file keywrod

     what is in my <keyword> shopping </keyword> <data_type> list </data_type> ?
     
     發現有data type 前面是keyword 比較難train 可以之後調整...

domian pattern 打算  07252019
=====================
from teams domain pattern
[qd_teams_domain_fst_lang_model_featurizer]
negative patterns 這個

domain.negative.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile

file_open -> FileOpenNegativeDomain
這個可能要加進來
這個是contextual negalive tlist 
read text ../lexicons/contextual_negative_list.txt;
define ContextualFileOpenEntity;
之後migrate contextual lu 可能需要有他來用

有其他相衝domain 的pattern
目前不打算把它加進去
如果是negative 就是doamin score = 0, 因為後面0.5 的限制 (但是在files 現在沒有) 所以不會trigger 後面的行為
如果以後需要 可能要家0.5 的threshold (or 別的threshold)

[qd_teams_domain_fst_lang_model_intent_overwrite_featurizer]
positive pattern 的部分
domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile

有file_open
file_download -> FileDownloadIntent 可能要家一下


file_download
file_navigation 
file_share

teamspace_sharechannel
teamspace_sharetab
    改成 file_share
    可能以後再evaluate 到底需不需要他
teamspace_search
    改成file_search
    
teamspace_navigate
    改成 file_navigate
    可能以後再evaluate 到底需不需要他
    
    
也要加
但是細節上可能要再調整
因為有些case 現在希望是file_search 了  根據files 的guideline
之後再調整


但是這個是沒有domain svm 的情況
可能測試一下是要前面or 後面


[qd_teams_domain_pattern_featurizer]
感覺是另外一個positive pattern 的位置
domain.override.infile

file_navigate
   跟 domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile 的file_navigate 不完全相同
   domain.override.infile 多了recent 了一些東西

file_open
   domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile 沒有這個  是posive pattern 可以加
teamspace_search
   domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile 完全依樣
   不用加
file_share
   跟 domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile 的file_navigate 不完全相同
   domain.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile cover 的比較多
   
   
yue 說當初一個pattern 是1.0 另一個是0.99 但是現在score 都是0.99 了  所以直接merge 取最大的就可以

intent.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile

這邊沒有必要的intent 不需要 做任何事


[qd_teams_intents_hotfix_featurizer]
luna_181019_teams.intents.hotfix

intent hotfix file
?  以後要hotfix可能需要他
   

=====================
slot pattern 打算  07252019
=====================
after slot lccrf

[qd_teams_slots_fst_lang_model_featurizer]
luna_190118_teams.slots.fst_lang_model
slot.fst_lang_model.tagger.infile
有position Ref 的pattern 但是不是order ref  schema 沒有不需要

目前把它加成partial overrider 的pattern 了
? 是不是要partial override 不太確定


=====================
canonical value  打算  07252019
=====================
for teams
param:datastorelookup_datastores=
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.teamsuser_activitytype.txt,
// 需要
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.teamsuser_contactname.txt,
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.teammeeting_quantifier.txt,
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.slide_number.txt,
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.teamspace_tab.txt,
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.teamsuser_status.txt,
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.position_ref.txt,
// 需要
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.file_filerecency.txt,
但是改成自己的 
然後只有recent  沒有most recent 了

// 需要
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.file_filetype.txt,
//需要
luna_teams_slots.canonicalentities.file_sharetarget.txt,



for files
要自己加
order_ref
從communication 借用一下
luna_communication_enus_mv1.canonicalentities.order_ref.txt
but 他的不make sence
先用自己的word 來搞定

sharetarget_name
?好像是this 以後要加再說  現在先不管



====================================
