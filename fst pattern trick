This forwarded email (see attached) might help with your “set scene <wildcard> in <location>” problem.

Mingzhu describes how to force “share file <wildcard> with <person>” to win over “share file <wildcard>”

====================================================

Context: I was looking at some DSATs and thinking about how to fix them with FST:


要討論的example
Share file specs with roger, in which we tagged “specs with roger” as file name.

If we have two rules: 
“share file <wildcard:filename>” and 
“share file < wildcard:filename> with <person>” 
how can we make sure that the second one is preferred? ?

Or if we have one rule with optional tokens: “share file <wildcard:filename> {with <person>}”, 
how can we prevent the greedy wildcard matching here?



conclusion
To the best of my knowledge, FST wildcard match is greedy matching (finding the longest one). We can double check FST‘s related document to sick some clue of conservative matching. 
Base on my knowledge, here is my input about the rules you mentioned.   Rule 1 will cover all the case about “share file *’, which is conflict with Rule 2, and as Rule1 is the longest match,  Rule 2  don’t have the chance to win.

fst 跟QPCfile 不一樣的原因
========================================
BOS share the <file_title>lt review. pptx</file_title> file
BOS go to the <slide_name>marketing</slide_name> slide
BOS go to a <slide_name>marketing</slide_name> slide
BOS go to the <slide_name>cookie</slide_name> slide
BOS go to a <slide_name>cookie</slide_name> slide
BOS Go to the very <slide_number>last</slide_number> slide
BOS go to very <slide_number>last</slide_number> slide
BOS go to very last Slide
BOS Go to very last Slide
BOS Go to the marketing slide
BOS go to the marketing Slide
BOS Go to Main Functionality Slide
BOS Go to Main Functionality slide
BOS go to <slide_name>Main Functionality</slide_name> slide

可能的
in fst 因該是大小寫有差
in QPC 因該是大小寫沒有差

可能要qpc 為準....  如果覺得fst 沒有make sense
