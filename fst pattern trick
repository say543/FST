The boundary symbol .#. indicates the beginning of a
string in the left context and the 
end of a string in the right context. It has no special
meaning anywhere else.

Double-Vertical-Bar Rules The most commonly used form, the right-arrow,
double-vertical-bar rules, were introduced above in Section 3.5.2. You will recall
that these rules are based on the following template
A -> B || L _ R
where A, B, L and R are regular expressions, denoting languages (not relations),
and L and R are optional. The overall rule denotes a relation. The left context L
is extended by default on the left, and the right context R on the right, with ?*,
the universal language. The .#. notation may be used to override this default
and indicate the beginning and/or end of a word. These notational conventions will
hold for the other subtypes of replace rules to be presented.

following template
A @-> B || L _ R

[A .o. B] denotes the composition of the relation A with the relation
B. If A contains the string pair x, y and B contains y, z , the
composite relation [A .o. B] contains the string pair x, z .
Composition is associative but not commutative. We can write

[A => L _ R] denotes the language of strings that have the property
that any string from A that occurs as a substring is immediately
preceded by some string from L and immediately followed by some
string from R. We call L and R here the LEFT and the RIGHT context of
A, respectively. For example, [a => b _ c] includes all strings that
contain no occurrence of “a” and all strings like “back-to-back”
that completely satisfy the condition, but no strings such as “cab” or
“pack”.

[A -> B || L R]
Every replaced substring in the upper language is immediately preceded
by an upper-side string from L and immediately followed by an
upper-side string from R.

Similarly, [a -> 0 || .#.] deletes only the final
a, but [a -> 0 \\ .#.] deletes all the as at the end of a word like “baa”.

This forwarded email (see attached) might help with your “set scene <wildcard> in <location>” problem.

Mingzhu describes how to force “share file <wildcard> with <person>” to win over “share file <wildcard>”

====================================================

Context: I was looking at some DSATs and thinking about how to fix them with FST:


要討論的example
Share file specs with roger, in which we tagged “specs with roger” as file name.

If we have two rules: 
“share file <wildcard:filename>” and 
“share file < wildcard:filename> with <person>” 
how can we make sure that the second one is preferred? ?

Or if we have one rule with optional tokens: “share file <wildcard:filename> {with <person>}”, 
how can we prevent the greedy wildcard matching here?



conclusion
To the best of my knowledge, FST wildcard match is greedy matching (finding the longest one). We can double check FST‘s related document to sick some clue of conservative matching. 
Base on my knowledge, here is my input about the rules you mentioned.   Rule 1 will cover all the case about “share file *’, which is conflict with Rule 2, and as Rule1 is the longest match,  Rule 2  don’t have the chance to win.

可能的
in fst 因該是大小寫有差
in QPC 因該是大小寫沒有差

可能要qpc 為準....  如果覺得fst 沒有make sense
